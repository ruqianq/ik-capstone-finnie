# Complete Guide to Bond Investing

## What Are Bonds?

Bonds are fixed-income securities representing a loan from you (the investor) to a borrower (government, corporation, or municipality). In exchange, the borrower pays regular interest and returns your principal at maturity.

## How Bonds Work

### Key Bond Terms
- **Face Value (Par)**: The amount paid back at maturity (typically $1,000)
- **Coupon Rate**: Annual interest rate paid on face value
- **Coupon Payment**: Actual interest payment (usually semi-annual)
- **Maturity Date**: When principal is returned
- **Yield**: Total return considering price paid and interest received

### Bond Pricing
Bonds can trade above or below face value:
- **Premium**: Price above par (when coupon > market rates)
- **Discount**: Price below par (when coupon < market rates)
- **Par**: Price equals face value

## Types of Bonds

### Government Bonds
- **Treasury Bills (T-Bills)**: Short-term (4, 13, 26, 52 weeks), sold at discount
- **Treasury Notes**: Medium-term (2-10 years), semi-annual interest
- **Treasury Bonds**: Long-term (20-30 years), semi-annual interest
- **TIPS**: Inflation-protected, principal adjusts with CPI
- **I Bonds**: Savings bonds with inflation protection

### Municipal Bonds
Issued by state and local governments:
- **General Obligation (GO)**: Backed by taxing authority
- **Revenue Bonds**: Backed by specific project revenue (toll roads, airports)
- **Tax Advantage**: Often exempt from federal (and sometimes state) taxes
- **Tax-Equivalent Yield**: Muni yield ÷ (1 - tax rate)

### Corporate Bonds
Issued by companies:
- **Investment Grade**: BBB/Baa or higher rating, lower yields, lower risk
- **High Yield (Junk)**: Below BBB/Baa, higher yields, higher default risk
- **Convertible Bonds**: Can convert to company stock
- **Callable Bonds**: Issuer can redeem early

### Other Bond Types
- **Agency Bonds**: Government-sponsored entities (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac)
- **International Bonds**: Foreign government or corporate debt
- **Zero-Coupon Bonds**: No periodic payments, sold at deep discount

## Bond Ratings

Credit rating agencies assess default risk:

| Rating | Moody's | S&P/Fitch | Risk Level |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Highest Quality | Aaa | AAA | Lowest |
| High Quality | Aa1-Aa3 | AA+/AA/AA- | Very Low |
| Upper Medium | A1-A3 | A+/A/A- | Low |
| Medium | Baa1-Baa3 | BBB+/BBB/BBB- | Moderate |
| Speculative | Ba1-Ba3 | BB+/BB/BB- | Higher |
| Highly Speculative | B1-B3 | B+/B/B- | High |
| Substantial Risk | Caa-C | CCC-C | Very High |
| Default | D | D | In Default |

## Key Bond Concepts

### Yield Types
- **Current Yield**: Annual coupon ÷ current price
- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**: Total return if held to maturity
- **Yield to Call (YTC)**: Return if bond called early
- **Yield to Worst (YTW)**: Lowest of YTM or YTC

### Interest Rate Risk
Bond prices move inversely to interest rates:
- **Rates rise → Bond prices fall**
- **Rates fall → Bond prices rise**
- Longer maturities have greater price sensitivity

### Duration
Measures bond price sensitivity to rate changes:
- **Modified Duration**: Approximate % price change for 1% rate change
- Higher duration = more interest rate risk
- Example: 5-year duration means ~5% price drop if rates rise 1%

### Credit Spread
Yield difference between corporate and Treasury bonds:
- Wider spreads indicate higher perceived risk
- Spreads widen during economic uncertainty
- Tighter spreads suggest confidence in corporate creditworthiness

## Bond Investment Strategies

### Laddering
Divide investment across multiple maturities:
- Example: Equal amounts in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-year bonds
- As each matures, reinvest at longest rung
- Reduces interest rate risk, maintains liquidity

### Barbell Strategy
Concentrate in short and long maturities:
- Short-term provides liquidity and rate flexibility
- Long-term captures higher yields
- Skip intermediate maturities

### Bullet Strategy
Concentrate maturities around a target date:
- All bonds mature near when you need funds
- Good for specific goals (college, home purchase)

## Bond Funds vs. Individual Bonds

### Individual Bonds
**Pros**:
- Guaranteed return of principal at maturity
- Predictable income stream
- Control over credit quality and maturity

**Cons**:
- Requires larger investment for diversification
- Less liquidity
- Research-intensive

### Bond Funds (Mutual Funds/ETFs)
**Pros**:
- Instant diversification
- Professional management
- High liquidity
- Low minimum investment

**Cons**:
- No maturity date (NAV fluctuates)
- Management fees
- Less control over holdings

## Building a Bond Portfolio

### Allocation Considerations
- **Age**: Increase bond allocation as you approach retirement
- **Risk Tolerance**: Conservative investors favor higher bond allocation
- **Income Needs**: Retirees often need bond income
- **Interest Rate Environment**: Consider duration based on rate outlook

### Diversification
- Mix government and corporate bonds
- Vary credit qualities (don't chase yield with junk bonds only)
- Stagger maturities
- Consider international bonds for additional diversification

## Tax Considerations

- **Taxable Bonds**: Interest taxed as ordinary income
- **Municipal Bonds**: Often federal tax-exempt; may be state exempt too
- **Treasury Securities**: Federal tax applies; exempt from state/local taxes
- **Capital Gains**: Selling before maturity may trigger gains/losses
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold taxable bonds in IRAs/401(k)s when possible
