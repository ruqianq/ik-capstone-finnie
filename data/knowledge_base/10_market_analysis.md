# Market Analysis Guide

## Types of Market Analysis

Investors use two primary approaches to analyze investments: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Many successful investors combine both methods.

## Fundamental Analysis

### What It Is
Evaluating a company's intrinsic value based on financial data, industry position, and economic factors. The goal is to determine if a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced.

### Financial Statement Analysis

#### Income Statement
Shows profitability over a period:
- **Revenue**: Total sales/income
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue minus cost of goods sold
- **Operating Income**: Gross profit minus operating expenses
- **Net Income**: Bottom line profit after all expenses and taxes

Key metrics:
- **Gross Margin**: Gross profit ÷ Revenue
- **Operating Margin**: Operating income ÷ Revenue
- **Net Profit Margin**: Net income ÷ Revenue
- **EPS**: Net income ÷ Shares outstanding

#### Balance Sheet
Snapshot of financial position:
- **Assets**: What the company owns
- **Liabilities**: What the company owes
- **Shareholders' Equity**: Assets minus liabilities

Key metrics:
- **Current Ratio**: Current assets ÷ Current liabilities (>1 is healthy)
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Total debt ÷ Shareholders' equity
- **Book Value**: Shareholders' equity ÷ Shares outstanding

#### Cash Flow Statement
Shows actual cash movements:
- **Operating Cash Flow**: Cash from core business
- **Investing Cash Flow**: Capital expenditures, acquisitions
- **Financing Cash Flow**: Debt, dividends, stock issuance

Key metrics:
- **Free Cash Flow**: Operating cash flow minus capital expenditures
- **Cash Flow per Share**: Operating cash flow ÷ Shares outstanding

### Valuation Metrics

#### Price Ratios
| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| P/E Ratio | Price ÷ EPS | Lower may indicate value |
| Forward P/E | Price ÷ Expected EPS | Based on projections |
| P/B Ratio | Price ÷ Book value | Below 1 may be undervalued |
| P/S Ratio | Market cap ÷ Revenue | Useful for unprofitable companies |
| PEG Ratio | P/E ÷ Growth rate | Below 1 often considered undervalued |

#### Dividend Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Dividend Yield | Annual dividend ÷ Price | Income return |
| Payout Ratio | Dividends ÷ Net income | Sustainability |
| Dividend Coverage | EPS ÷ Dividend per share | Ability to maintain dividend |

#### Profitability Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| ROE | Net income ÷ Equity | Return on shareholder investment |
| ROA | Net income ÷ Assets | Efficiency of asset use |
| ROIC | NOPAT ÷ Invested capital | Return on capital deployed |

### Qualitative Factors
Beyond numbers, analyze:
- **Competitive advantage (moat)**: Brand, patents, network effects
- **Management quality**: Track record, ownership, compensation
- **Industry trends**: Growth potential, disruption risk
- **Regulatory environment**: Government policy impact
- **Economic sensitivity**: How economy affects the business

## Technical Analysis

### What It Is
Studying price movements and patterns to predict future price direction. Based on the premise that historical patterns repeat and prices reflect all known information.

### Price Charts

#### Chart Types
- **Line Chart**: Closing prices connected
- **Bar Chart**: Open, high, low, close for each period
- **Candlestick**: Visual representation of price action

#### Candlestick Patterns
Bullish patterns:

### Moving Averages

#### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Average price over specified period:
- **50-day SMA**: Medium-term trend
- **200-day SMA**: Long-term trend
- **Golden Cross**: 50-day crosses above 200-day (bullish)
- **Death Cross**: 50-day crosses below 200-day (bearish)

#### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Weights recent prices more heavily:
- More responsive to new information
- 12-day and 26-day common for short-term

### Support and Resistance

#### Support
Price level where buying interest prevents further decline:
- Previous lows
- Moving averages
- Round numbers
- Fibonacci levels

#### Resistance
Price level where selling pressure prevents further rise:
- Previous highs
- Moving averages
- Round numbers
- Psychological barriers

### Technical Indicators

#### Momentum Indicators

**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
- Scale: 0-100
- Above 70: Overbought (may decline)
- Below 30: Oversold (may rise)
- Look for divergences with price

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
- Difference between 12-day and 26-day EMA
- Signal line: 9-day EMA of MACD
- Crossovers indicate momentum shifts

**Stochastic Oscillator**
- Compares closing price to price range
- Above 80: Overbought
- Below 20: Oversold

#### Volume Indicators

**On-Balance Volume (OBV)**
- Running total of volume
- Rising OBV confirms uptrend
- Falling OBV confirms downtrend

**Volume Profile**
- Shows volume at different price levels
- High volume nodes act as support/resistance

#### Volatility Indicators

**Bollinger Bands**
- 20-day SMA with bands at ±2 standard deviations
- Wide bands: High volatility
- Narrow bands: Low volatility (often precedes breakout)

**ATR (Average True Range)**
- Measures volatility
- Useful for setting stop losses
- Higher ATR = more volatile

## Market Indicators

### Broad Market Health

### Sector Analysis

#### Sector Rotation
Economic cycle affects sectors differently:
1. **Early recovery**: Financials, consumer discretionary
2. **Mid-cycle**: Technology, industrials
3. **Late cycle**: Energy, materials
4. **Recession**: Consumer staples, utilities, healthcare

#### Relative Strength
Compare sector performance to broad market:
- Outperforming sectors attract momentum
- Underperforming may be value opportunity or warning

## Economic Indicators

## Using Analysis for Decisions

### Combining Approaches
Best practices:
1. Use fundamentals to identify WHAT to buy
2. Use technicals to determine WHEN to buy
3. Monitor economic indicators for broader context

### Risk Management
Regardless of analysis:
- Set position size limits
- Use stop losses appropriately
- Diversify across sectors and assets
- Don't ignore conflicting signals

### Limitations
No analysis method is perfect:
- Past patterns may not repeat
- Markets can remain irrational
- Black swan events disrupt all models
- Overconfidence is dangerous
