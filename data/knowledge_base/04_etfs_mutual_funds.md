# ETFs and Mutual Funds Guide

## Overview

ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that allow investors to own diversified portfolios without buying individual securities. Both offer professional management and diversification, but differ in structure and trading mechanics.

## Mutual Funds

### How Mutual Funds Work
- Pooled money from multiple investors
- Professional fund manager makes investment decisions
- Priced once daily after market close (NAV - Net Asset Value)
- Buy/sell directly from fund company at end-of-day NAV

### Types of Mutual Funds

#### By Investment Style
- **Actively Managed**: Managers try to beat benchmark
- **Index Funds**: Track specific market index passively
- **Target-Date Funds**: Auto-adjust allocation based on retirement year

#### By Asset Class
- **Stock Funds**: Invest primarily in equities
- **Bond Funds**: Invest in fixed income securities
- **Balanced Funds**: Mix of stocks and bonds
- **Money Market Funds**: Short-term, low-risk securities

#### By Strategy
- **Growth Funds**: Focus on capital appreciation
- **Value Funds**: Seek undervalued companies
- **Income Funds**: Prioritize dividend/interest income
- **Sector Funds**: Concentrate in specific industries

### Mutual Fund Costs
- **Expense Ratio**: Annual operating costs (0.05% to 2%+)
- **Load Fees**: Sales commissions
  - Front-end load: Paid when buying
  - Back-end load: Paid when selling
  - No-load: No sales commission
- **12b-1 Fees**: Marketing and distribution costs
- **Trading Costs**: Hidden costs from portfolio turnover

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

### How ETFs Work
- Trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks
- Prices fluctuate throughout trading day
- Created/redeemed through authorized participants
- Most track an index (passive management)

### Types of ETFs

- **Sector ETFs**: Focus on specific industries
- **Thematic ETFs**: Target trends (clean energy, AI, cybersecurity)
- **Factor ETFs**: Target specific factors (value, momentum, quality)

#### By Asset Class
- **Stock ETFs**: Equity exposure (domestic, international)
- **Bond ETFs**: Fixed income (government, corporate, municipal)
- **Commodity ETFs**: Gold, silver, oil, agricultural products
- **Real Estate ETFs**: REITs and real estate companies

#### Special Types
- **Leveraged ETFs**: 2x or 3x daily index returns (high risk)
- **Inverse ETFs**: Profit when index falls (hedging tool)
- **Active ETFs**: Actively managed, growing category

### ETF Costs
- **Expense Ratio**: Annual fees (often 0.03% to 0.75%)
- **Bid-Ask Spread**: Difference between buy/sell prices
- **Brokerage Commissions**: Many brokers now offer commission-free
- **Premium/Discount**: Price may differ slightly from NAV

## Building a Portfolio with Funds

### Three-Fund Portfolio
Classic simple approach:

2. **Total International Stock Index** (20-30%)
3. **Total Bond Market Index** (20-40%)

### Core-Satellite Approach
- **Core** (70-80%): Broad market index funds
- **Satellite** (20-30%): Sector, thematic, or actively managed funds

### Target-Date Funds
All-in-one solution:
- Pick fund matching your retirement year
- Automatically rebalances and becomes more conservative over time
- Great for hands-off investors
- Examples: Vanguard Target Retirement 2050, Fidelity Freedom 2045

## Evaluating Funds

### Key Metrics
- **Expense Ratio**: Lower is better for similar funds
- **Tracking Error**: How closely fund follows its index
- **Holdings**: Understand what you're investing in
- **AUM (Assets Under Management)**: Larger funds often have lower costs
- **Turnover Ratio**: Higher turnover = more trading costs and taxes

### Performance Considerations
- Compare to appropriate benchmark
- Look at 3, 5, 10-year returns
- Consider risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

## Tax Efficiency

### Why ETFs Are More Tax-Efficient
- Creation/redemption mechanism avoids selling securities
- Fewer capital gains distributions
- Index funds have low turnover

### Tax-Smart Fund Placement
- **Taxable Accounts**: Tax-efficient index ETFs, municipal bond funds
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA/401k)**: Bond funds, high-turnover funds, REITs

## Common Mistakes

1. **Chasing Performance**: Yesterday's winners often become tomorrow's laggards
2. **Ignoring Costs**: Small fee differences compound significantly
3. **Over-Diversification**: Too many funds with overlapping holdings
4. **Market Timing**: Trying to predict when to buy/sell
5. **Ignoring Asset Allocation**: Funds don't matter if overall allocation is wrong
6. **Neglecting Rebalancing**: Let winners run too long, increasing risk
