# Complete Guide to Stock Investing

## What Are Stocks?

Stocks, also called equities or shares, represent ownership in a corporation. When you buy stock, you become a partial owner (shareholder) of that company, entitled to a portion of its assets and earnings.

## How Stocks Work

### Stock Exchanges
Stocks trade on exchanges like:
- **NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)**: Largest by market cap, traditional auction-style
- **NASDAQ**: Electronic exchange, tech-heavy
- **Other Global Exchanges**: LSE (London), TSE (Tokyo), SSE (Shanghai)

### Stock Prices
Prices are determined by supply and demand:
- More buyers than sellers → price rises
- More sellers than buyers → price falls
- News, earnings, economic data all influence sentiment

## Types of Stocks

### By Company Size (Market Capitalization)
- **Large-Cap**: $10+ billion market cap (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson)
- **Mid-Cap**: $2-10 billion (growth potential with some stability)
- **Small-Cap**: Under $2 billion (higher risk, higher potential returns)
- **Micro-Cap**: Under $300 million (very speculative)

### By Investment Style
- **Growth Stocks**: Companies growing revenue/earnings faster than market average
  - Higher P/E ratios, reinvest profits rather than pay dividends
  - Examples: Technology companies, biotech
- **Value Stocks**: Trading below intrinsic value based on fundamentals
  - Lower P/E ratios, often pay dividends
  - Examples: Utilities, financials, industrials
- **Income/Dividend Stocks**: Regular dividend payments
  - Mature companies with stable cash flows
  - Examples: REITs, utilities, consumer staples

### By Sector
The market is divided into 11 sectors:
1. Technology
2. Healthcare
3. Financials
4. Consumer Discretionary
5. Consumer Staples
6. Industrials
7. Energy
8. Materials
9. Utilities
10. Real Estate
11. Communication Services

- **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book)**: Stock price ÷ book value per share
  - Below 1.0 may indicate undervalued
- **PEG Ratio**: P/E ÷ earnings growth rate
  - Below 1.0 often considered undervalued
- **P/S Ratio (Price-to-Sales)**: Market cap ÷ annual revenue

### Profitability Metrics
- **EPS (Earnings Per Share)**: Net income ÷ outstanding shares
- **ROE (Return on Equity)**: Net income ÷ shareholders' equity
- **Profit Margin**: Net income ÷ revenue

### Dividend Metrics
- **Dividend Yield**: Annual dividend ÷ stock price

## Stock Analysis Methods

### Fundamental Analysis
Evaluating a company's financial health and intrinsic value:
- **Financial Statements**: Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow
- **Competitive Position**: Moat, market share, brand strength
- **Management Quality**: Track record, insider ownership
- **Industry Trends**: Growth potential, regulatory environment

### Technical Analysis
Studying price patterns and trading volume:
- **Moving Averages**: 50-day, 200-day trends
- **Support/Resistance**: Price levels where buying/selling concentrates
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Overbought (>70) or oversold (<30)
- **MACD**: Momentum indicator for trend changes

## Building a Stock Portfolio

### Diversification Guidelines
- **Number of Stocks**: 15-30 individual stocks for adequate diversification
- **Sector Allocation**: Don't exceed 25% in any single sector
- **Geographic Diversification**: Include international exposure

### Position Sizing
- **Core Holdings**: 3-5% of portfolio each
- **Satellite Holdings**: 1-2% of portfolio each
- **Never risk more than 10% on any single position**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Emotional Trading**: Buying high on excitement, selling low on fear
2. **Overtrading**: Excessive buying/selling erodes returns through fees
3. **Ignoring Fees**: Commissions and taxes impact long-term returns
4. **Concentration Risk**: Too much in one stock or sector
5. **Chasing Performance**: Past returns don't guarantee future results
6. **Ignoring Valuations**: Overpaying even for great companies

## Getting Started

### Steps for New Investors
1. Open a brokerage account (consider fees, research tools, ease of use)
2. Start with index funds or ETFs to learn the market
3. Research individual stocks thoroughly before buying
4. Start small and increase positions as you gain confidence
5. Reinvest dividends for compound growth
6. Review portfolio quarterly, rebalance annually

### Stock Screeners
Use screeners to find stocks matching your criteria:
- Finviz, Yahoo Finance, Morningstar
- Filter by market cap, P/E, dividend yield, sector

## Tax Considerations

- **Short-term gains** (held < 1 year): Taxed as ordinary income
- **Long-term gains** (held > 1 year): Preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)
- **Dividends**: Qualified dividends get preferential treatment
- **Tax-loss harvesting**: Offset gains with losses
