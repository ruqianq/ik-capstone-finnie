# Behavioral Finance Guide

## What is Behavioral Finance?

Behavioral finance studies how psychological influences and cognitive biases affect financial decisions. Understanding these patterns helps investors avoid common mistakes and make more rational choices.

## Key Concepts

### Rational vs. Behavioral View
**Traditional Finance**: Investors are rational, markets are efficient
**Behavioral Finance**: Investors are human, emotions and biases affect decisions

Reality combines both: Markets are mostly efficient, but psychology creates opportunities and pitfalls.

## Common Cognitive Biases
