# Complete 401(k) Guide

## What is a 401(k)?

A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to save and invest a portion of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. Named after the section of the Internal Revenue Code that created it.

## Types of 401(k) Plans

### Traditional 401(k)
- **Contributions**: Pre-tax (reduces current taxable income)
- **Growth**: Tax-deferred
- **Withdrawals**: Taxed as ordinary income
- **Best for**: Those expecting lower tax rates in retirement

### Roth 401(k)
- **Contributions**: After-tax (no immediate tax benefit)
- **Growth**: Tax-free
- **Qualified Withdrawals**: Tax-free
- **Best for**: Those expecting higher tax rates in retirement, younger workers

### Safe Harbor 401(k)
- Employer automatically passes nondiscrimination testing
- Requires mandatory employer contributions
- Either 3% nonelective or 4% matching

## Contribution Limits (2024)

| Category | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Employee Contribution | $23,000 |
| Catch-up (Age 50+) | $7,500 additional |
| Total with Catch-up | $30,500 |
| Combined Employee + Employer | $69,000 |

## Employer Matching

### Common Match Formulas
- **Dollar-for-dollar up to X%**: 100% match on first 3-6% of salary
- **Partial match**: 50% match on first 6% (equivalent to 3%)
- **Graded match**: Higher percentage on initial contributions

### Example
If you earn $100,000 and employer matches 100% up to 4%:
- You contribute 4% ($4,000)
- Employer contributes 4% ($4,000)
- Total: $8,000 per year

### Vesting
Employer contributions may vest over time:
- **Immediate vesting**: You own employer contributions right away
- **Cliff vesting**: 100% vested after X years (typically 3)
- **Graded vesting**: Partial vesting each year (typically 20% per year)

## Investment Options

### Common 401(k) Investments

#### Target-Date Funds
- All-in-one solution based on retirement year
- Automatically rebalances and gets more conservative
- Good for hands-off investors
- Look for low expense ratios

#### Index Funds
- Track market indices (S&P 500, Total Stock Market, Bond Index)
- Low fees, broad diversification
- Excellent core holding

#### Actively Managed Funds
- Professional managers pick investments
- Higher fees than index funds
- May outperform or underperform index

#### Company Stock
- Often available, sometimes with discount

### Building Your 401(k) Portfolio
1. **Determine allocation** based on age and risk tolerance
2. **Choose low-cost options** (expense ratios under 0.5%)
3. **Diversify** across asset classes
4. **Avoid overlap** in similar funds
5. **Rebalance** annually

## Strategies to Maximize Your 401(k)

### 1. Get the Full Match
Absolute priority - it's free money (100% return):
- Contribute at least enough to get full employer match
- Before paying off low-interest debt
- Before other investment accounts

### 2. Increase Contributions Over Time
- Raise contribution 1% each year
- Contribute raises and bonuses
- Target 10-15% of income eventually

### 3. Choose Low-Cost Investments
Fees compound over decades:
- 0.5% vs 1.5% fees = ~20% less at retirement
- Index funds typically cheapest
- Review fund expense ratios

### 4. Roth vs. Traditional Decision
Consider:
- Current vs. expected future tax rates
- Current marginal tax bracket
- Roth offers tax diversification
- Can split contributions between both

### 5. Catch-Up Contributions
If 50 or older:
- Additional $7,500 allowed (2024)
- Critical for those behind on savings
- Max out if possible

## Withdrawals and Distributions

### Early Withdrawal (Before 59½)
- 10% penalty PLUS ordinary income tax
- Exceptions: disability, death, QDRO, 55+ and separated from service
- Substantially equal periodic payments (72(t)) avoid penalty

### After 59½
- No penalty
- Taxed as ordinary income (traditional)
- Tax-free (Roth, if qualified)

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
- Begin at age 73 (SECURE 2.0)
- Must withdraw minimum amount annually
- Penalty: 25% of amount not withdrawn (was 50%)
- Roth 401(k)s now exempt from RMDs (starting 2024)

### Hardship Withdrawals
May be allowed for:
- Medical expenses
- Home purchase
- Tuition
- Funeral expenses
- Eviction/foreclosure prevention

Still subject to taxes and possible penalty.

## Leaving Your Employer

### Options for Old 401(k)

#### 1. Leave It
- If balance over $7,000, can usually stay
- Continue managing in old plan
- May have limited investment options

#### 2. Roll to New Employer's 401(k)
- Consolidates accounts
- Maintains creditor protection
- Check new plan's investment options

#### 3. Roll to IRA
- More investment choices
- Potentially lower fees
- More control
- Complete directly (trustee-to-trustee) to avoid taxes

#### 4. Cash Out (Usually Bad Idea)
- Taxes + 10% penalty (if under 59½)
- Lose years of tax-advantaged growth
- Only in extreme emergencies

### 60-Day Rollover Rule
If you receive funds directly:
- Must deposit in new account within 60 days
- Miss deadline = taxes + penalty
- Better to do direct rollover

## 401(k) Loans

### Basics
- Borrow up to 50% of balance (max $50,000)
- Pay yourself back with interest
- Typically 5-year repayment (longer for home purchase)

### Pros
- No credit check
- Interest goes to yourself
- No taxes if repaid

### Cons
- Missing market gains while repaying
- If you leave job, often due immediately
- If you can't repay, becomes taxable distribution
- Reduces retirement savings

**Recommendation**: Avoid 401(k) loans except in emergencies
