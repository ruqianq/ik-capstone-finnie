## Strategies

### Start Early
Time is your ally:
- More years of tax-free growth
- Lower monthly contributions needed
- Can weather market volatility

### Contribute Regularly
- Automate monthly contributions
- Increase with raises
- Consider gifts from family

### Grandparent Contributions
Benefits:
- Estate planning (removes from estate)
- Gift tax annual exclusion applies
- Super-funding available

Considerations:
- FAFSA treatment (see below)
- Consider account ownership structure

### Superfunding
Contribute 5 years of gifts at once:
- $90,000 per beneficiary (or $180,000 married)
- Spread over 5 years for gift tax purposes
- Great for lump sums (inheritance, bonus)
- Cannot give additional gifts during 5 years

## FAFSA Considerations

### Account Ownership Impact
| Owner | Asset Counted As | Impact |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| Parent | Parent asset | ~5.64% EFC |
| Grandparent | Not counted as asset | Distributions counted as income |
| Student | Student asset | ~20% EFC |

### FAFSA Simplification (2024+)
Changes affect grandparent-owned plans:
- Distributions no longer reported as income
- Makes grandparent ownership more attractive
- Consult current FAFSA rules

## Non-Qualified Withdrawals

### If Funds Not Used for Education
- Earnings portion taxable as income
- 10% penalty on earnings
- Principal (contributions) returned tax-free

### Penalty Exceptions
No 10% penalty if beneficiary:
- Receives scholarship (up to scholarship amount)
- Attends military academy
- Dies or becomes disabled

### Alternatives to Non-Qualified Withdrawal
- Change beneficiary to family member
- Use for own education
- Save for grandchildren
- Pay student loans ($10,000 limit)
- Roll to Roth IRA (new option, restrictions apply)

## Changing Beneficiaries

### Allowed Changes
Can change to qualified family member:
- Siblings (including step-siblings)
- Parents, grandparents
- Aunts, uncles, cousins
- Spouse of any of above
- Child of any of above

### Strategy Uses
- Older child doesn't need all funds
- Child gets scholarship
- Child doesn't attend college
- Multiple generations sharing

## New: 529 to Roth IRA Rollover

### SECURE 2.0 Rules (2024+)
- 529 must be open 15+ years
- Lifetime limit: $35,000 per beneficiary
- Subject to Roth IRA annual limits
- Must be in beneficiary's name
- Contributions from last 5 years excluded

### Strategy Implications
- Reduces risk of unused 529 funds
- Provides retirement benefit
- Encourages earlier 529 funding

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not using for state tax benefit**: Missing deduction
2. **Choosing plan based only on marketing**: Compare fees
3. **Being too conservative early**: Missing growth
4. **Overfunding**: More than education costs need
5. **Not considering financial aid impact**: Ownership matters
6. **Forgetting to update beneficiary**: If circumstances change
7. **Paying non-qualified expenses**: Penalties and taxes
8. **Not using for K-12**: If applicable and beneficial
9. **Ignoring grandparent gift opportunities**: Estate planning
10. **Waiting too long to start**: Missing compound growth
