# HSA and FSA Guide

## Overview

Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) are tax-advantaged accounts for healthcare expenses. Understanding their differences helps maximize tax savings.

## Health Savings Account (HSA)

### What is an HSA?
A tax-advantaged savings account for medical expenses, available only with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Often called the "triple tax advantage" account.

### Triple Tax Advantage
1. **Tax-deductible contributions**: Reduce taxable income
2. **Tax-free growth**: Investments grow without tax
3. **Tax-free withdrawals**: For qualified medical expenses

### Eligibility Requirements
Must have qualifying HDHP:
- 2024 minimum deductible: $1,600 (individual), $3,200 (family)
- 2024 max out-of-pocket: $8,050 (individual), $16,100 (family)

Cannot have:
- Other health coverage (some exceptions)
- Medicare enrollment
- FSA (general purpose)

### Contribution Limits (2024)
| Coverage Type | Under 55 | 55+ (Catch-up) |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Individual | $4,150 | $5,150 |
| Family | $8,300 | $9,300 |

### Key Benefits

#### Funds Never Expire
- Roll over year to year
- Portable between jobs
- Keep forever

#### Investment Options
- Can invest beyond cash balance
- Growth compounds tax-free
- Treat like retirement account

#### Retirement Benefits
After age 65:
- Withdraw for any purpose (taxed as income, like traditional IRA)
- Still tax-free for medical expenses
- Excellent supplement to retirement accounts

### Qualified Medical Expenses
Tax-free withdrawals for:
- Doctor visits and copays
- Prescriptions
- Dental and vision care
- Mental health services
- Medical equipment
- Medicare premiums (after 65)
- Long-term care insurance premiums
- Many more (see IRS Publication 502)

### HSA Strategies

#### Triple Tax Strategy
1. Contribute maximum each year
2. Invest for growth (if long time horizon)
3. Pay current medical expenses out-of-pocket
4. Save receipts
5. Withdraw tax-free in retirement

#### Receipt Tracking
- No time limit on reimbursement
- Pay now, reimburse years later
- Keep digital copies of receipts
- Apps and tools help manage

#### HSA as Retirement Account
Consider maxing HSA before additional IRA:
- Same tax benefits as Traditional IRA
- Plus tax-free medical withdrawals
- No RMDs
- Great for healthcare in retirement

### Contribution Methods
- Employer payroll deduction (avoids FICA taxes)
- Direct contribution (deducted on tax return)
- Employer contributions (don't count toward your limit)
- Rollover from another HSA

## Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

### What is an FSA?
Employer-sponsored account for healthcare or dependent care expenses with tax benefits. Contributions reduce taxable income.

### Types of FSAs

#### Healthcare FSA
- For medical, dental, vision expenses
- Available with any health plan
- Pre-tax contributions
- 2024 limit: $3,200

#### Limited Purpose FSA
- Dental and vision only
- Can have alongside HSA
- Same contribution limit

#### Dependent Care FSA
- For childcare or eldercare
- While you work
- 2024 limit: $5,000 ($2,500 if married filing separately)

### Key Features

#### Use-It-or-Lose-It (Modified)
Funds generally must be used in plan year, but:
- **Rollover**: Up to $640 can roll to next year (employer option)
- **Grace period**: Extra 2.5 months to use funds (employer option)
- Employers choose one, both, or neither

#### Available Immediately
- Full election available January 1
- Even before fully funded through payroll
- Example: Elect $3,200, use $3,200 in January

### Contribution Considerations
- Estimate annual healthcare expenses
- Don't over-contribute (risk forfeiture)
- Consider planned procedures
- Review dental/vision needs

### Qualified Expenses
Similar to HSA:
- Copays and deductibles
- Prescriptions
- Dental and vision care

- Higher income often benefits more from FSA
- Lower income may prefer credit
- Calculate both scenarios

## Strategic Use

### Maximize HSA
If eligible:
1. Contribute maximum each year
2. Invest for long-term growth
3. Pay medical expenses from other funds if possible
4. Let HSA grow for retirement

### Coordinate with FSA
If not HSA-eligible:
1. Estimate annual medical expenses
2. Contribute anticipated amount to FSA
3. Don't over-contribute (forfeiture risk)
4. Use throughout year

### Limited Purpose FSA + HSA
Best of both:
1. Max HSA for medical and investment
2. Use LP-FSA for dental/vision
3. Increased total tax-advantaged amount

### Year-End FSA Strategies
If funds remaining:
- Stock up on supplies (contacts, glasses)
- Schedule dental cleanings
- Complete preventive care
- Purchase needed medical equipment
- Buy OTC medications

## Common Mistakes

### HSA Mistakes
1. Not contributing maximum
2. Not investing beyond cash
3. Using for non-qualified expenses (penalties)
4. Closing account when changing jobs
5. Contributing when not HDHP-covered

### FSA Mistakes
1. Over-contributing (forfeiture)
2. Under-contributing (missing tax savings)
3. Not using by deadline
4. Forgetting dependent care option
5. Not checking employer's rollover policy

## Tax Implications

### Non-Qualified HSA Withdrawals
Before 65:
- Income tax on withdrawal
- 20% penalty

After 65:
- Income tax only (like traditional IRA)
- No penalty

### FSA Non-Qualified Use
- Income tax
- May face penalties
- Employer may require repayment
