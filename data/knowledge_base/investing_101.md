# Introduction to Investing

## What is Compound Interest?
Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It is essentially "interest on interest."

## Key Concepts
*   **Principal**: The original sum of money borrowed in a loan or put into an investment.
*   **Interest Rate**: The proportion of a loan that is charged as interest to the borrower, typically expressed as an annual percentage.
*   **Compounding Frequency**: How often the interest is calculated and added to the principal (e.g., annually, monthly, daily).

## Example
If you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded annually:
*   Year 1: You earn $50. Total: $1,050.
*   Year 2: You earn $52.50 (5% of $1,050). Total: $1,102.50.
