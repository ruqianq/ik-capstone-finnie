# Social Security Guide

## What is Social Security?

Social Security is a federal insurance program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. Funded through payroll taxes (FICA), it serves as a foundation of retirement income for most Americans.

## How Social Security Works

### Funding
- Workers pay 6.2% of earnings (up to wage base)
- Employers match with 6.2%
- Self-employed pay 12.4%
- 2024 wage base: $168,600

### Eligibility
- Need 40 credits (quarters) to qualify
- Earn up to 4 credits per year
- 2024: $1,730 per credit
- Minimum 10 years of work required

### Benefit Calculation
Based on highest 35 earning years:
1. Earnings adjusted for inflation (indexed)
2. Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) calculated
3. Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) determined using formula
4. Adjustments for claiming age applied

## When to Claim

### Claiming Ages

| Age | Impact on Benefit |
|-----|-------------------|
| 62 | Reduced ~25-30% permanently |
| Full Retirement Age (FRA) | 100% of PIA |
| 70 | Increased ~24-32% vs FRA |

### Full Retirement Age by Birth Year
| Birth Year | FRA |
|------------|-----|
| 1943-1954 | 66 |
| 1955 | 66 + 2 months |
| 1956 | 66 + 4 months |
| 1957 | 66 + 6 months |
| 1958 | 66 + 8 months |
| 1959 | 66 + 10 months |
| 1960+ | 67 |

### Delayed Retirement Credits
Each year delayed past FRA until 70:
- 8% increase per year
- Maximum at age 70
- No benefit to waiting past 70

## Claiming Strategies

### When to Claim Early (62)
Consider if:
- Health concerns limiting life expectancy
- Immediate income needed
- Can invest benefits
- Spouse will claim higher benefit

### When to Wait Until FRA or Later
Consider if:
- Good health and longevity expected
- Have other income sources
- Want maximum survivor benefit
- Still working (benefits reduced before FRA)

### Break-Even Analysis
Calculate when waiting pays off:
- Early claimers get more checks initially
- Later claimers get larger checks
- Break-even typically around age 80
- After break-even, waiters receive more total

### Spousal Strategies

#### Married Couples
- Spouse can claim up to 50% of worker's PIA
- Higher earner often benefits from delaying
- Maximize survivor benefit for longer-lived spouse

#### Claiming Options
- Both claim on own record
- Lower earner claims spousal benefit
- Coordinate timing for maximum household benefit

### Divorced Spouse Benefits
If married 10+ years:
- Can claim on ex-spouse's record
- Ex-spouse benefit unaffected
- Must be unmarried
- Cannot claim if remarried (exceptions apply)

### Survivor Benefits
Surviving spouse can receive:
- 100% of deceased spouse's benefit at FRA
- Reduced if claimed earlier
- Can switch between own and survivor benefit
- Strategy: Claim one early, switch to other later

## Working While Receiving Benefits

### Before Full Retirement Age
Earnings limit applies:
- 2024 limit: $22,320 per year
- $1 withheld for every $2 over limit
- Year reaching FRA: Higher limit ($59,520)
- $1 withheld for every $3 over limit
- Only months before FRA count

### At and After FRA
- No earnings limit
- Work as much as you want
- Benefits not reduced

### Withheld Benefits
Not lost—recalculated at FRA:
- Benefit increased to account for withheld amounts
- May take years to recover withheld benefits
- Consider in claiming decision

## Taxation of Benefits

### Federal Taxes
Based on "combined income":
```
Combined Income = AGI + Nontaxable Interest + 50% of SS Benefits
```

| Filing Status | Combined Income | Amount Taxable |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Single | Under $25,000 | 0% |
| Single | $25,000-$34,000 | Up to 50% |
| Single | Over $34,000 | Up to 85% |
| Married | Under $32,000 | 0% |
| Married | $32,000-$44,000 | Up to 50% |
| Married | Over $44,000 | Up to 85% |

### State Taxes
- Most states don't tax Social Security
- Some tax partially or fully
- Check your state's rules

### Reducing Taxes on Benefits
- Manage other income sources
- Use Roth withdrawals (not included in combined income)
- Time large distributions carefully
- Consider Roth conversions before claiming

## Common Situations

### Disability Benefits (SSDI)
- For those unable to work due to disability
- Must meet strict medical criteria
- 5-month waiting period
- Converts to retirement at FRA

### Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
- Need-based program
- For aged, blind, disabled with limited resources
- Not based on work history
- Asset and income limits apply

### Government Pension Offset (GPO)
If receiving government pension from non-SS-covered work:
- Spousal/survivor SS benefit reduced
- Reduction: 2/3 of government pension
- May eliminate SS benefit entirely

### Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)
If receiving pension from non-SS-covered work:
- SS retirement benefit reduced
- Affects own SS benefit (not spousal)
- Complex calculation based on years of coverage

## Maximizing Benefits

### Strategies
1. **Work at least 35 years**: Zeros hurt average
2. **Maximize earnings**: Higher income = higher benefit
3. **Delay if possible**: Up to 8% per year increase
4. **Coordinate spousal claims**: Maximize household benefit
5. **Consider survivor needs**: Higher earner's delay helps survivor

### What Counts in Calculation
- Only earnings up to wage base
- Years with highest indexed earnings
- Credits for military service
- Credits for caregiving (limited circumstances)

## Social Security Planning

### Get Your Statement
- Create account at ssa.gov
- Review earnings history for errors
- See estimated benefits at 62, FRA, 70

### Factors in Decision
- Health and life expectancy
- Other income sources
- Spouse's benefits
- Tax situation
- Working plans
- Cash needs

### Common Mistakes
1. **Claiming too early**: Permanent reduction
2. **Not checking earnings record**: Errors reduce benefits
3. **Ignoring spousal strategies**: Leave money on table
4. **Working before FRA without planning**: Benefits withheld
5. **Not considering survivor benefits**: Affects surviving spouse
6. **Assuming SS won't exist**: Still funded even without reform
7. **Relying solely on SS**: Replace only 40% of income average

## The Future of Social Security

### Current Status
- Trust fund projected to run short around 2033
- Would still pay ~77% of benefits from ongoing payroll taxes
- Congress has historically acted to maintain system

### Possible Reforms
- Raising retirement age
- Increasing payroll tax
- Raising wage base
- Means-testing benefits
- Combination approaches

### Planning Approach
- Don't count on SS as only income
- Build personal savings
- Consider SS as foundation, not entire plan
- Stay informed on policy changes
