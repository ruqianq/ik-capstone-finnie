# Investment Basics

## What is Investing?
Investing is the act of allocating money or resources with the expectation of generating income or profit over time. Unlike saving, which preserves money, investing aims to grow wealth through various financial instruments.

## Why Invest?
- **Beat Inflation**: Average inflation erodes purchasing power at 2-3% annually. Investments can outpace this.
- **Build Wealth**: Compound growth accelerates wealth accumulation over time.
- **Achieve Financial Goals**: Retirement, education, home purchase, and other long-term objectives.
- **Generate Passive Income**: Dividends, interest, and rental income provide ongoing returns.

## Types of Investments

### Stocks (Equities)
Stocks represent ownership shares in a company. When you buy stock, you become a partial owner.
- **Common Stock**: Voting rights, variable dividends
- **Preferred Stock**: Fixed dividends, no voting rights, priority in bankruptcy
- **Growth Stocks**: Companies reinvesting profits for expansion
- **Value Stocks**: Underpriced companies with solid fundamentals
- **Dividend Stocks**: Regular income payments to shareholders

### Bonds (Fixed Income)
Bonds are loans you make to governments or corporations in exchange for regular interest payments.
- **Government Bonds**: Treasury bonds, notes, bills (safest)
- **Municipal Bonds**: State/local government, often tax-free
- **Corporate Bonds**: Higher yield, more risk
- **Bond Ratings**: AAA (safest) to D (default)

### Mutual Funds
Professionally managed pools of money from multiple investors.
- **Actively Managed**: Fund managers pick investments
- **Index Funds**: Track market indices passively
- **Target-Date Funds**: Automatically adjust allocation based on retirement date

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks on exchanges.
- **Lower Fees**: Typically cheaper than mutual funds
- **Tax Efficient**: Fewer capital gains distributions
- **Flexibility**: Buy/sell anytime during market hours
- **Transparency**: Holdings disclosed daily

### Real Estate
Physical property or Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
- **Direct Ownership**: Rental properties, appreciation
- **REITs**: Trade like stocks, own commercial properties
- **Real Estate Crowdfunding**: Fractional property ownership

## Risk vs. Return
Higher potential returns generally come with higher risk.
- **Low Risk**: Government bonds, CDs, money market funds
- **Medium Risk**: Corporate bonds, dividend stocks, balanced funds
- **High Risk**: Growth stocks, small-caps, emerging markets, cryptocurrency

## Time Horizon
Your investment timeline affects appropriate strategies:
- **Short-term (< 3 years)**: Savings accounts, CDs, money market
- **Medium-term (3-10 years)**: Balanced funds, bonds, conservative stocks
- **Long-term (10+ years)**: Growth stocks, equity funds, aggressive allocation

## Dollar-Cost Averaging
Investing fixed amounts at regular intervals regardless of market conditions.
- Reduces impact of market volatility
- Removes emotion from investment decisions
- Automatically buys more shares when prices are low
- Works well for long-term investors

## Asset Allocation
Dividing investments among different asset categories.
- **Conservative**: 70% bonds, 30% stocks
- **Moderate**: 50% bonds, 50% stocks
- **Aggressive**: 20% bonds, 80% stocks
- **Age-based Rule**: 100 minus your age = stock percentage (rough guide)
