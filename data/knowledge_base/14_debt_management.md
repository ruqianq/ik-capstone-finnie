# Debt Management Guide

## Understanding Debt

Debt is money borrowed that must be repaid with interest. While some debt can be useful (mortgages, education), excessive or high-interest debt can derail financial goals.

## Types of Debt

### Good Debt vs. Bad Debt

#### Good Debt (May Build Wealth)
- **Mortgage**: Builds home equity, potential appreciation
- **Student Loans**: Investment in earning potential
- **Business Loans**: Creates income-generating assets
- Typically lower interest rates
- May have tax benefits

#### Bad Debt (Destroys Wealth)
- **Credit Cards**: High interest, depreciating purchases
- **Payday Loans**: Extremely high interest
- **Auto Loans (excessive)**: Depreciating asset
- **Personal Loans for consumption**: No asset backing

### Secured vs. Unsecured

| Secured Debt | Unsecured Debt |
|--------------|----------------|
| Backed by collateral | No collateral |
| Lower interest rates | Higher interest rates |
| Mortgage, auto loans | Credit cards, personal loans |
| Can lose asset if default | Wage garnishment, collections |

## Debt Metrics

### Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
```
DTI = Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income
```
| DTI | Interpretation |
|-----|----------------|
| Under 20% | Excellent |
| 20-35% | Acceptable |
| 36-49% | Concerning |
| 50%+ | Crisis level |

### Credit Utilization
```
Utilization = Credit Card Balance ÷ Credit Limit
```
- Keep under 30% for good credit score
- Under 10% is ideal
- High utilization hurts credit score

## Debt Repayment Strategies

### Debt Avalanche Method
Pay highest interest rate first:
1. List debts by interest rate (highest to lowest)
2. Make minimum payments on all
3. Put extra money toward highest rate debt
4. When paid off, move to next highest
5. Repeat until debt-free

**Pros**: Mathematically optimal, saves most money
**Cons**: May take longer to see progress

### Debt Snowball Method
Pay smallest balance first:
1. List debts by balance (smallest to largest)
2. Make minimum payments on all
3. Put extra money toward smallest balance
4. When paid off, move to next smallest
5. Repeat until debt-free

**Pros**: Quick wins, psychological motivation
**Cons**: May pay more interest overall

### Hybrid Approach
Combine based on your situation:
- Start with snowball for momentum
- Switch to avalanche after a few wins
- Prioritize any debt with consequences (secured)

## Credit Card Debt

### Average Credit Card Interest
- Average APR: 20-25%
- Some cards exceed 30%
- Minimum payments mostly cover interest

### Payoff Calculator
$5,000 balance at 20% APR:
| Monthly Payment | Time to Payoff | Total Interest |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Minimum (~$100) | 9+ years | $6,600+ |
| $200 | 32 months | $1,314 |
| $300 | 19 months | $785 |
| $500 | 11 months | $456 |

### Strategies to Accelerate Payoff
- **Balance Transfer**: Move to 0% intro APR card
- **Negotiate**: Ask for lower rate
- **Stop using cards**: Switch to cash/debit
- **Increase payments**: Even small amounts help
- **Side income**: Dedicate extra earnings to debt

## Student Loans

### Federal vs. Private

| Federal Loans | Private Loans |
|---------------|---------------|
| Fixed interest rates | Variable or fixed |
| Income-driven repayment options | Limited flexibility |
| Potential forgiveness programs | Rarely forgiven |
| Deferment/forbearance options | Less flexible |

### Federal Repayment Plans
- **Standard**: Fixed payments, 10 years
- **Graduated**: Lower at first, increases over time
- **Extended**: Up to 25 years
- **Income-Driven (IDR)**: Based on income and family size
  - IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, ICR options
  - Forgiveness after 20-25 years
  - PSLF: Forgiveness after 10 years in public service

### Student Loan Strategies
1. Understand your loans (federal vs. private, rates)
2. Consider refinancing if good credit and stable income
3. Pay more than minimum when possible
4. Target highest rate loans first
5. Don't extend term unnecessarily

## Mortgage Debt

### Is Early Payoff Right for You?

#### Consider Early Payoff If:
- Rate is higher than investment returns
- Near retirement
- Psychological preference for debt-free
- Already maxing retirement accounts

#### Keep Mortgage If:
- Low rate (under 4-5%)
- Tax deduction is valuable
- Can invest difference at higher return
- Liquidity is important

### Extra Payment Strategies
- **Round up payments**: Pay $1,500 instead of $1,423
- **Bi-weekly payments**: 26 half-payments = 13 monthly payments
- **One extra payment per year**: Directly to principal
- **Refinance to shorter term**: 15 years vs. 30 years

### Example Impact
$300,000 mortgage at 6%, 30 years:
| Strategy | Time Saved | Interest Saved |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| $100 extra/month | 5 years | $56,000 |
| $200 extra/month | 9 years | $92,000 |
| Bi-weekly payments | 4 years | $44,000 |

## Debt Consolidation

### Options

#### Balance Transfer Cards
- 0% intro APR for 12-21 months
- 3-5% transfer fee
- Must pay off before rate increases
- Requires good credit

#### Personal Loans
- Fixed rate, fixed term
- Often lower than credit card rates
- Single monthly payment
- No collateral needed

#### Home Equity Loan/HELOC
- Lower rates (secured by home)
- Interest may be tax-deductible
- Risk: Lose home if can't pay
- Larger amounts available

#### 401(k) Loans
- Borrow from yourself
- No credit check
- Risk: Job loss means repayment due
- Missing market returns
- **Generally not recommended**

### When Consolidation Makes Sense
- Lower overall interest rate
- Single manageable payment
- Won't accumulate new debt
- Have stable income

### When to Avoid Consolidation
- Trading unsecured for secured debt (risky)
- Extending term significantly
- Likely to run up new debt
- Fees exceed interest savings

## Negotiating with Creditors

### Options If Struggling

#### Hardship Programs
- Temporarily reduced payments
- Lower interest rates
- Waived fees
- Contact creditor before missing payments

#### Debt Settlement
- Negotiate to pay less than owed
- Usually 40-60% of balance
- Damages credit score
- Tax implications (forgiven debt may be income)
- Consider carefully

#### Bankruptcy
Last resort options:
- **Chapter 7**: Liquidation, discharge most debts
- **Chapter 13**: Repayment plan over 3-5 years
- Consult bankruptcy attorney
- Significant credit impact (7-10 years on report)

## Staying Debt-Free

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Budget**: Know where money goes
2. **Emergency fund**: Avoid debt for unexpected expenses
3. **Wait 24-48 hours**: Before large purchases
4. **Use cash/debit**: Harder to overspend
5. **Track spending**: Awareness prevents excess

### When Borrowing Makes Sense
- Asset acquisition (home, education, business)
- Interest rate below investment returns
- Can comfortably make payments
- Clear repayment plan exists
