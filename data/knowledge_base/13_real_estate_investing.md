# Real Estate Investing Guide

## Why Invest in Real Estate?

Real estate offers unique benefits as an asset class, including income generation, appreciation potential, tax advantages, and portfolio diversification.

## Types of Real Estate Investments

### Direct Ownership

#### Primary Residence
- Not strictly an investment (you need somewhere to live)
- Builds equity over time
- Mortgage interest deduction (if itemizing)
- Capital gains exclusion ($250K single, $500K married)

#### Rental Properties
- Generate monthly income from tenants
- Appreciation over time
- Tax deductions for expenses
- Active involvement required (or hire property manager)

#### Fix-and-Flip
- Buy undervalued properties
- Renovate to increase value
- Sell for profit
- Requires expertise, capital, and time
- Higher risk than long-term holding

### Indirect Real Estate Investment

#### REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)
Companies that own, operate, or finance real estate:
- **Equity REITs**: Own physical properties
- **Mortgage REITs**: Hold mortgages and loans
- **Hybrid REITs**: Combination of both

Benefits:
- Liquidity (trade on exchanges)
- Diversification across many properties
- Professional management
- Required to distribute 90% of income as dividends
- No property management hassles

#### Real Estate Mutual Funds and ETFs
- Own diversified portfolio of REITs
- Even more diversified than single REIT
- Low minimum investment
- Professional management

#### Real Estate Crowdfunding
- Invest in specific properties or portfolios
- Lower minimums than direct ownership
- Less liquid than REITs
- Platforms: Fundrise, CrowdStreet, RealtyMogul

#### Real Estate Syndications
- Pool money with other investors
- Professional sponsor manages property
- Typically accredited investors only
- Less liquid, but potential for higher returns

## Evaluating Rental Properties

### Key Metrics

#### Cash Flow
Monthly income minus expenses:
```
Cash Flow = Rent - (Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance + Maintenance + Vacancy + Management)
```
Positive cash flow essential for long-term success.

#### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
```
Cap Rate = Net Operating Income ÷ Property Value
```
- Higher cap rate = higher potential return (and often higher risk)
- Typical range: 4-10%
- Market dependent

#### Cash-on-Cash Return
```
Cash-on-Cash = Annual Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested
```
- Measures return on your actual cash investment
- Target: 8-12% or higher

#### 1% Rule
Monthly rent should be at least 1% of purchase price:
- $200,000 property should rent for $2,000/month
- Quick screening tool, not definitive
- Works in some markets, not others

#### 50% Rule
Operating expenses typically run 50% of rent:
- If rent is $2,000, expect $1,000 for expenses
- Helps estimate cash flow quickly
- Excludes mortgage payment

### Due Diligence Checklist
- [ ] Property inspection
- [ ] Title search
- [ ] Comparable sales analysis
- [ ] Rental market analysis
- [ ] Review of financials (if existing rental)
- [ ] Neighborhood research
- [ ] Zoning verification
- [ ] Insurance quotes

## Financing Rental Properties

### Conventional Mortgages
- 15-25% down payment typically required for investment
- Higher interest rates than primary residence
- Strong credit required (700+)
- Limit on number of properties (usually 10)

### Portfolio Loans
- Held by lender (not sold to Fannie/Freddie)
- More flexible requirements
- May be higher rates
- Good for investors with many properties

### Commercial Loans
- For larger properties (5+ units)
- Based on property income, not personal income
- Shorter terms (5-10 years), then refinance
- Larger down payments

### Creative Financing
- Seller financing
- Lease options
- Subject-to existing financing
- Private money lenders
- Requires more expertise and caution

## Tax Benefits of Real Estate

### Deductions
- Mortgage interest
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Maintenance and repairs
- Property management fees
- Travel to manage property
- Professional services (accountant, attorney)

### Depreciation
- Deduct cost of building over 27.5 years (residential)
- Reduces taxable income without cash expense
- Example: $275,000 building = $10,000 annual deduction
- Recaptured at sale (25% rate)

### 1031 Exchange
Defer capital gains by reinvesting in "like-kind" property:
- 45 days to identify replacement property
- 180 days to close
- Must be equal or greater value
- Can defer indefinitely if continue exchanging

### Qualified Opportunity Zones
Invest capital gains in designated areas:
- Defer original gain
- Reduce gain if held 5+ years
- Exclude appreciation if held 10+ years

## REIT Investing

### Types of REITs

| Type | Focus | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| Retail | Shopping centers, malls | Simon Property, Realty Income |
| Residential | Apartments | AvalonBay, Equity Residential |
| Office | Office buildings | Boston Properties |
| Industrial | Warehouses, logistics | Prologis |
| Healthcare | Hospitals, senior housing | Welltower, Ventas |
| Hotel | Hotels and resorts | Host Hotels |
| Data Center | Server facilities | Digital Realty, Equinix |
| Infrastructure | Cell towers, fiber | American Tower, Crown Castle |

### Evaluating REITs

#### Funds From Operations (FFO)
- Net income + depreciation - gains from sales
- Better measure than EPS for REITs
- P/FFO ratio similar to P/E

#### Adjusted FFO (AFFO)
- FFO minus maintenance capital expenditures
- More conservative measure
- Closer to actual cash available for dividends

#### Dividend Yield
- Annual dividend ÷ share price
- REITs typically yield 3-8%
- Compare to sector averages

#### Payout Ratio
- Dividends ÷ FFO
- Below 100% is sustainable
- Much above 100% is concerning

## Real Estate in Your Portfolio

### Allocation Guidelines
- Typical recommendation: 5-20% of portfolio
- Can be higher for income-focused investors
- Include in retirement accounts for tax efficiency

### Diversification Within Real Estate
- Multiple property types

- Mix of REITs and direct ownership if possible
- Public and private real estate

### Rebalancing
