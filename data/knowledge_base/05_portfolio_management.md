# Portfolio Management Guide

## What is Portfolio Management?

Portfolio management is the art and science of selecting and overseeing investments to meet long-term financial objectives while managing risk. It involves building, maintaining, and adjusting a collection of assets to achieve optimal returns for your risk tolerance.

## Core Principles

### Diversification
Don't put all your eggs in one basket:
- **Asset Class Diversification**: Stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities
- **Geographic Diversification**: Domestic and international investments
- **Sector Diversification**: Spread across different industries
- **Company Diversification**: Multiple companies within each sector
- **Time Diversification**: Invest regularly over time (dollar-cost averaging)

### Asset Allocation
The most important investment decision:
- Determines 80-90% of portfolio returns according to research
- Balance between risk and return based on your profile
- Adjust as goals and circumstances change

### Risk Management
Understanding and controlling portfolio risk:
- **Systematic Risk**: Market-wide risk (cannot be diversified away)
- **Unsystematic Risk**: Company/sector-specific (can be diversified)
- Use asset allocation to manage total portfolio risk

## Asset Allocation Strategies

### By Age/Life Stage

#### Young Investors (20s-30s)
- **Aggressive Growth**: 80-90% stocks, 10-20% bonds
- Long time horizon allows recovery from downturns
- Focus on accumulation and growth

#### Mid-Career (40s-50s)
- **Moderate Growth**: 60-70% stocks, 30-40% bonds
- Balance growth with increasing stability
- Begin thinking about retirement income

#### Near/In Retirement (60s+)
- **Conservative**: 40-50% stocks, 50-60% bonds
- Preserve capital while generating income
- Maintain some growth for 20-30 year retirement

### By Risk Tolerance

| Profile | Stocks | Bonds | Cash | Suitable For |
|---------|--------|-------|------|--------------|
| Conservative | 20-30% | 50-60% | 10-30% | Risk-averse, short horizon |
| Moderate Conservative | 35-45% | 45-55% | 5-15% | Some risk tolerance |
| Moderate | 50-60% | 35-45% | 5-10% | Balanced approach |
| Moderate Aggressive | 65-75% | 20-30% | 0-5% | Growth-focused |
| Aggressive | 80-90% | 5-15% | 0-5% | Long horizon, high risk tolerance |

## Building Your Portfolio

### Step 1: Determine Your Goals
- Retirement (when, how much income needed)
- Major purchases (home, education)
- Wealth building
- Income generation

### Step 2: Assess Your Situation
- Time horizon to each goal
- Risk tolerance (emotional and financial)
- Current financial position
- Income stability and future expectations

### Step 3: Choose Asset Allocation
Based on goals, timeline, and risk tolerance:
- Use age-based rules as starting point
- Adjust for personal circumstances
- Consider multiple goals with different allocations

### Step 4: Select Investments
Fill each asset class bucket:
- **U.S. Stocks**: Total market or S&P 500 index funds
- **International Stocks**: Developed and emerging markets
- **Bonds**: Government, corporate, municipal mix
- **Alternatives**: Real estate (REITs), commodities (optional)

### Step 5: Implement and Monitor
- Fund your accounts
- Set up automatic investments if possible
- Review quarterly, rebalance as needed

## Rebalancing

### What is Rebalancing?
Periodically adjusting portfolio back to target allocation:
- Sell assets that have grown beyond target
- Buy assets that have fallen below target
- Maintains intended risk level

### Rebalancing Methods

#### Calendar Rebalancing
- Review at set intervals (quarterly, semi-annually, annually)
- Simple and systematic
- Annual rebalancing is often sufficient

#### Threshold Rebalancing
- Rebalance when allocation drifts by set percentage (e.g., 5%)
- More responsive to market movements
- Requires monitoring

#### Hybrid Approach
- Review quarterly, but only rebalance if thresholds exceeded
- Balances responsiveness with simplicity

### Rebalancing Considerations
- **Transaction Costs**: Minimize by rebalancing less frequently
- **Tax Implications**: Prefer rebalancing in tax-advantaged accounts
- **New Contributions**: Direct new money to underweight assets
- **Dividends**: Reinvest in underweight areas

## Portfolio Construction Models

### Three-Fund Portfolio
Simple, effective approach:
1. Total U.S. Stock Market Index (50-60%)
2. Total International Stock Index (20-30%)
3. Total Bond Market Index (20-30%)

### Four-Fund Portfolio
Adds real estate:
1. Total U.S. Stock Market (40-50%)
2. Total International Stock Market (20-25%)
3. Total Bond Market (20-25%)
4. Real Estate (REITs) (5-10%)

### Lazy Portfolios
Well-known model portfolios:
- **Bogleheads Three-Fund**: U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds
- **All-Weather Portfolio**: Stocks, long-term bonds, intermediate bonds, commodities, gold
- **Permanent Portfolio**: 25% each in stocks, long-term bonds, gold, cash

## Risk Metrics

### Standard Deviation
Measures volatility of returns:
- Higher = more volatile
- Compare to benchmarks and peer funds

### Beta
Measures sensitivity to market movements:
- Beta of 1.0 = moves with market
- Beta > 1.0 = more volatile than market
- Beta < 1.0 = less volatile than market

### Sharpe Ratio
Risk-adjusted return metric:
- (Portfolio return - Risk-free rate) / Standard deviation
- Higher is better
- Compares return earned per unit of risk

### Maximum Drawdown
Largest peak-to-trough decline:
- Important for understanding worst-case scenarios
- Historical drawdowns may repeat

## Common Portfolio Mistakes

1. **No Written Plan**: Invest without clear strategy
2. **Emotional Decisions**: Panic selling, greed buying
3. **Checking Too Often**: Daily monitoring causes anxiety
4. **Ignoring Costs**: Fees erode returns over time
5. **Home Country Bias**: Over-allocating to domestic stocks
6. **Chasing Returns**: Buying yesterday's winners
7. **Market Timing**: Trying to predict short-term moves
8. **Neglecting Rebalancing**: Letting allocation drift
9. **Over-Diversification**: Too many overlapping funds
10. **Ignoring Taxes**: Not considering tax efficiency
