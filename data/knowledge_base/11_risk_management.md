# Investment Risk Management

## Understanding Investment Risk

Risk is the possibility that an investment's actual return will differ from expected. All investments carry some degree of risk, but understanding and managing it can significantly improve outcomes.

## Types of Investment Risk

### Market Risk (Systematic Risk)
Affects all investments in a market:
- **Equity Risk**: Stock market declines
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Rising rates hurt bond prices
- **Inflation Risk**: Purchasing power erosion
- **Currency Risk**: Exchange rate fluctuations

Cannot be diversified away; must be managed through asset allocation.

### Specific Risk (Unsystematic Risk)
Affects individual investments:
- **Business Risk**: Company-specific problems
- **Credit Risk**: Bond issuer default
- **Liquidity Risk**: Difficulty selling at fair price
- **Concentration Risk**: Too much in one investment

Can be reduced through diversification.

## Measuring Risk

### Standard Deviation
Measures volatility of returns:
- Higher standard deviation = more volatile
- S&P 500 historical standard deviation: ~15-20%
- Bonds typically 5-10%

### Beta
Measures sensitivity to market movements:
| Beta | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| 1.0 | Moves with market |
| > 1.0 | More volatile than market |
| < 1.0 | Less volatile than market |
| Negative | Moves opposite to market |

### Maximum Drawdown
Largest peak-to-trough decline:
- S&P 500 drawdowns: -50% in 2008, -34% in 2020
- Important for understanding worst-case scenarios
- Consider if you could stay invested during such declines

### Sharpe Ratio
Risk-adjusted return measure:
```
Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) ÷ Standard Deviation
```
- Higher is better
- Above 1.0 is good
- Above 2.0 is excellent

### Value at Risk (VaR)
Estimates potential loss over a time period at a confidence level:
- Example: 95% VaR of $10,000 means 5% chance of losing more than $10,000
- Used by institutions, less common for individual investors

## Risk Tolerance Assessment

### Factors Affecting Risk Tolerance

#### Financial Capacity
- Income stability
- Emergency fund size
- Time to retirement
- Net worth
- Dependents

#### Emotional Capacity
- How would you react to a 30% portfolio decline?
- Would you sell at the bottom or stay invested?
- Sleep test: Can you sleep with this portfolio?

### Risk Tolerance Categories

| Level | Stock Allocation | Suitable For |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Conservative | 20-30% | Near retirement, low tolerance |
| Moderately Conservative | 35-45% | 5-10 years to retirement |
| Moderate | 50-60% | Balanced approach |
| Moderately Aggressive | 65-75% | 10-20 years to retirement |
| Aggressive | 80-95% | Young, high tolerance |

## Risk Management Strategies

### Diversification

#### Asset Class Diversification
Don't rely on one asset type:
- Stocks for growth
- Bonds for stability
- Real estate for diversification
- Cash for liquidity

#### Geographic Diversification
- Domestic stocks
- Developed international
- Emerging markets
- Reduces country-specific risk

#### Sector Diversification
Spread across industries:
- Technology, Healthcare, Financials
- Consumer, Industrials, Energy
- Avoid overweighting any sector

#### Individual Security Diversification
For stock portfolios:
- Minimum 15-20 stocks for basic diversification
- 30+ provides most diversification benefit
- Or use index funds for instant diversification

### Asset Allocation
Most important risk management decision:
- Determines majority of portfolio risk and return
- Match to risk tolerance and time horizon
- Rebalance to maintain target allocation

### Rebalancing
Maintain intended risk level:
- Sell winners, buy laggards
- Annual or threshold-based (5% drift)
- Prevents portfolio drift toward higher risk

### Dollar-Cost Averaging
Regular investment regardless of market:
- Reduces timing risk
- Buys more shares when prices low
- Emotional comfort during volatility
- Best for ongoing savings

### Position Sizing
Limit exposure to any single investment:
- No single stock > 5-10% of portfolio
- No single sector > 20-25%
- Prevents catastrophic losses from one failure

### Stop-Loss Orders
Predetermined exit points:
- Limit downside on individual positions
- Consider trailing stops for winners
- Be aware of gap risk and whipsaws

## Behavioral Risk Management

### Common Behavioral Pitfalls

#### Loss Aversion
Losses feel twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good:
- Leads to holding losers too long
- Selling winners too soon
- Solution: Systematic rules-based approach

#### Recency Bias
Overweighting recent events:
- Buying high after run-up
- Selling after decline
- Solution: Long-term perspective, historical context

#### Overconfidence
Believing you can beat the market:
- Excessive trading
- Concentrated positions
- Solution: Index funds, diversification

#### Herd Mentality
Following the crowd:
- Buying bubbles
- Panic selling
- Solution: Contrarian thinking, stick to plan

### Building Resilience
- Write investment policy statement
- Automate contributions and rebalancing
- Avoid checking portfolio daily
- Keep long-term perspective
- Have trusted advisor or accountability partner

## Risk in Different Life Stages

### Young Investors (20s-30s)
- Can take more risk (long time horizon)
- Recovery time for market downturns
- Focus on growth
- Biggest risk: Not investing enough

### Mid-Career (40s-50s)
- Gradually reduce risk
- Balance growth with stability
- Sequence of returns risk emerges
- Diversify across account types

### Near/In Retirement (60s+)
- Capital preservation important
- Need growth to fund 20-30 year retirement
- Sequence of returns risk is highest
- Consider bucket strategy

## Risk Management Mistakes

1. **Taking too much risk** for situation
2. **Taking too little risk** for time horizon
3. **Ignoring inflation** (hidden risk)
4. **Concentration** in single stock or sector
5. **Timing the market** instead of time in market
6. **Panic selling** during downturns
7. **Not having emergency fund** (forced selling)
8. **Leverage** in retirement accounts
9. **Chasing yield** without understanding risk
10. **Neglecting rebalancing**

## Crisis Management

### When Markets Crash
1. **Don't panic sell** - realizes losses
2. **Review your plan** - is allocation still appropriate?
3. **Rebalance** - buy stocks on sale
4. **Tax-loss harvest** - capture losses for tax benefit
5. **Stay invested** - time in market beats timing

### Historical Perspective
Markets have recovered from every crash:
- 1929 Great Depression: Recovered
- 1987 Black Monday: Recovered
- 2000 Dot-com bust: Recovered
- 2008 Financial Crisis: Recovered
- 2020 COVID crash: Recovered

Long-term investors who stayed invested benefited.
