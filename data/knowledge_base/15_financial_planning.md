# Personal Financial Planning Guide

## What is Financial Planning?

Financial planning is the process of setting goals, assessing your current situation, and creating a roadmap to achieve your financial objectives. It's not just about investing—it encompasses all aspects of your financial life.

## The Financial Planning Process

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Situation

#### Net Worth Statement
Assets (what you own):
- Cash and savings accounts
- Investment accounts
- Retirement accounts
- Real estate equity
- Vehicle value
- Other assets

Liabilities (what you owe):
- Mortgage balance
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Credit card debt
- Other debts

**Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities**

Track net worth monthly or quarterly to see progress.

#### Cash Flow Analysis
Income:
- Salary/wages
- Investment income
- Side income
- Other sources

Expenses:
- Fixed (housing, insurance, debt payments)
- Variable (food, utilities, entertainment)
- Periodic (vacations, holidays, repairs)

**Savings Rate = (Income - Expenses) ÷ Income**
Target: 15-20% minimum

### Step 2: Define Your Goals

#### SMART Goals Framework
- **Specific**: Clear and defined
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable target
- **Achievable**: Realistic given situation
- **Relevant**: Aligned with values
- **Time-bound**: Has deadline

#### Common Financial Goals

| Goal | Timeline | Priority |
|------|----------|----------|
| Emergency fund | 6-12 months | High |
| Pay off high-interest debt | 1-3 years | High |
| Down payment for home | 3-7 years | Medium |
| Children's education | 10-18 years | Medium |
| Retirement | 20-40 years | High |
| Financial independence | Varies | Medium |

### Step 3: Create Your Plan

#### Priority Order
1. Basic emergency fund ($1,000)
2. Employer 401(k) match
3. High-interest debt payoff
4. Full emergency fund (3-6 months)
5. Max retirement contributions
6. Other goals (house, education)
7. Additional investing

#### Budget Framework
Popular approaches:
- **50/30/20**: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings
- **Pay yourself first**: Save set amount immediately, spend rest
- **Zero-based**: Every dollar has a job
- **Envelope system**: Cash allocated to categories

### Step 4: Implement

#### Automate Your Finances
- Direct deposit to multiple accounts
- Automatic 401(k) contributions
- Automatic IRA contributions
- Automatic bill payments
- Automatic savings transfers

#### Action Items
- Open necessary accounts
- Set up automatic transfers
- Create tracking system
- Schedule regular reviews

### Step 5: Monitor and Adjust

#### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Track spending, check progress
- **Quarterly**: Review investments, assess goals
- **Annually**: Comprehensive plan review
- **Life events**: Adjust for major changes

## Key Financial Ratios

### Savings Rate
```
Savings Rate = Total Savings ÷ Gross Income
```
- Target: 15-20% minimum for retirement
- Include employer match
- Higher is better for early retirement

### Debt Ratios
```
DTI = Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income
Housing Ratio = Housing Costs ÷ Gross Monthly Income
```
- Total DTI: Under 36% ideal
- Housing: Under 28% recommended

### Emergency Fund Ratio
```
Emergency Fund Ratio = Liquid Savings ÷ Monthly Expenses
```
- Target: 3-6 months expenses
- Higher for variable income

### Investment Rate
```
Investment Rate = Annual Investments ÷ Annual Income
```
- Target: 15-20% of gross income for retirement
- More for early retirement goals
