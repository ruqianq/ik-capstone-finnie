# Complete IRA Guide

## What is an IRA?

An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a tax-advantaged account for retirement savings. Unlike 401(k)s, IRAs are opened individually, not through employers, giving you more control over investment choices.

## Types of IRAs

### Traditional IRA

#### Tax Treatment
- **Contributions**: May be tax-deductible (depends on income and workplace plan)
- **Growth**: Tax-deferred
- **Withdrawals**: Taxed as ordinary income

#### Deduction Limits (2024) - If Covered by Workplace Plan
| Filing Status | Full Deduction | Partial Deduction | No Deduction |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Single | MAGI ≤ $77,000 | $77,001-$87,000 | > $87,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | MAGI ≤ $123,000 | $123,001-$143,000 | > $143,000 |

If NOT covered by workplace plan but spouse is:
| Filing Status | Full Deduction | Partial Deduction |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Married Filing Jointly | MAGI ≤ $230,000 | $230,001-$240,000 |

#### Who It's Best For
- Those without workplace retirement plan
- Those who can take full deduction
- Those expecting lower tax rate in retirement

### Roth IRA

#### Tax Treatment
- **Contributions**: After-tax (no deduction)
- **Growth**: Tax-free
- **Qualified Withdrawals**: Tax-free (after 59½ and 5-year rule)

#### Income Limits (2024)
| Filing Status | Full Contribution | Partial | Ineligible |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| Single | MAGI ≤ $146,000 | $146,001-$161,000 | > $161,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | MAGI ≤ $230,000 | $230,001-$240,000 | > $240,000 |

#### Unique Benefits
- No RMDs during owner's lifetime
- Contributions (not earnings) can be withdrawn anytime tax and penalty-free
- Tax-free growth forever if rules followed
- Great for estate planning

#### Who It's Best For
- Young workers (decades of tax-free growth)
- Those expecting higher taxes in retirement
- Those who want tax diversification
- High earners (via backdoor Roth)

### SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension)

For self-employed and small business owners:
- Contribution up to 25% of net self-employment income (max $69,000)
- Only employer contributions (no employee deferrals)
- Same rules as Traditional IRA for investments and withdrawals
- Easy to set up and maintain

### SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan)

For small businesses with 100 or fewer employees:
- Employee contributions up to $16,000 ($19,500 if 50+)
- Employer must contribute (match up to 3% or 2% nonelective)
- Two-year waiting period for rollovers to other IRAs
- 25% penalty for early withdrawal within first two years

## Contribution Limits (2024)

| IRA Type | Under 50 | 50 and Over |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Traditional & Roth (combined) | $7,000 | $8,000 |
| SEP IRA | Up to $69,000 | Up to $69,000 |
| SIMPLE IRA | $16,000 | $19,500 |

**Note**: Traditional and Roth share the same limit. You can split between them but can't exceed total.

## Traditional vs. Roth Decision

### Choose Traditional If:
- You're in a high tax bracket now
- You expect significantly lower taxes in retirement
- You need the tax deduction now
- You can't contribute to Roth (income too high)

### Choose Roth If:
- You're in a low tax bracket now
- You expect higher taxes in retirement
- You want tax-free income in retirement
- You want flexibility (contribution withdrawals anytime)
- You want to avoid RMDs

### Both is Often Best
Tax diversification lets you:
- Control taxable income in retirement
- Adapt to future tax law changes
- Withdraw from optimal account based on situation

## Backdoor Roth IRA

For high earners above Roth income limits:

### Steps
1. Contribute to Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
2. Convert to Roth IRA
3. Pay tax on any gains (ideally convert quickly)
4. File Form 8606 with tax return

### Pro-Rata Rule Warning
If you have existing Traditional IRA funds:
- Conversion is taxed proportionally across ALL Traditional IRA assets
- Can't selectively convert just the non-deductible amount
- Solution: Roll existing Traditional IRA into 401(k) first

### Mega Backdoor Roth
If your 401(k) allows after-tax contributions:
1. Max out regular 401(k) contributions ($23,000)
2. Make after-tax contributions (up to $69,000 total limit)
3. Convert to Roth 401(k) or roll to Roth IRA
4. Potentially $69,000+ in Roth per year

## Investment Strategies for IRAs

### Take Advantage of Control
Unlike 401(k)s with limited options:
- Full range of stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds
- Individual stocks if desired
- Lower-cost funds available

### Asset Location Strategy
Where to hold different investments:
- **Roth IRA**: Highest growth investments (stocks, small cap)
- **Traditional IRA**: Bonds, REITs (tax-inefficient assets)
- **Taxable**: Tax-efficient investments (index funds, municipal bonds)

### Sample Portfolios by Age

#### Age 30 (Aggressive)
- 70% U.S. Stock Index
- 20% International Stock Index
- 10% Bond Index

#### Age 50 (Moderate)
- 50% U.S. Stock Index
- 20% International Stock Index
- 30% Bond Index

#### Age 65 (Conservative)
- 35% U.S. Stock Index
- 15% International Stock Index
- 50% Bond Index

## Withdrawal Rules

### Traditional IRA

| Age | Rules |
|-----|-------|
| Under 59½ | 10% penalty + income tax (exceptions apply) |
| 59½ to 72 | No penalty, taxed as income |
| 73+ | RMDs required, penalties for not taking |

### Roth IRA

| Situation | Tax/Penalty |
|-----------|-------------|
| Contributions anytime | Tax-free, penalty-free (already taxed) |
| Earnings before 59½ | Tax + 10% penalty |
| Qualified distribution (59½ + 5-year rule) | Completely tax-free |

### Early Withdrawal Exceptions (No 10% Penalty)
Both Traditional and Roth:
- Disability
- First-time home purchase (up to $10,000 lifetime)
- Qualified education expenses
- Health insurance while unemployed
- Unreimbursed medical expenses
- Birth or adoption (up to $5,000)
- Substantially equal periodic payments (72(t))

## Roth Conversion Strategies

### When to Convert
- Low income years (job loss, sabbatical, early retirement)
- Before Social Security starts
- Before RMDs begin
- When tax rates are temporarily low
- Market downturns (same shares, lower taxes)

### How to Convert
1. Open Roth IRA if you don't have one
2. Request conversion from Traditional IRA
3. Decide amount to convert
4. Pay taxes owed from non-IRA funds if possible
5. Report on tax return

### Conversion Considerations
- Pay taxes with outside funds to maximize Roth
- Consider impact on Medicare premiums (IRMAA)
- Conversions are permanent (can't undo)
- Plan multi-year conversions to manage tax brackets

## IRA Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing contribution deadline** (April 15 for prior year)
2. **Contributing after income limits** (excess contribution penalty)
3. **Not naming beneficiaries** (or outdated designations)
4. **Taking early withdrawals** unnecessarily
5. **Ignoring RMDs** (25% penalty on amount not taken)
6. **Pro-rata rule surprises** with backdoor Roth
7. **Excessive trading** (still taxed on conversion even if losses)
8. **Not understanding 5-year rule** for Roth
9. **Holding cash** instead of investing contributions
10. **High-fee investments** when better options available
