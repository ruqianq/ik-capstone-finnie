# Retirement Planning Guide

## The Retirement Planning Process

Retirement planning involves setting retirement income goals and making decisions to achieve them. The earlier you start, the more time compound growth works in your favor.

## Key Retirement Concepts

### The 4% Rule
A guideline for sustainable retirement withdrawals:
- Withdraw 4% of portfolio in year one
- Adjust for inflation each subsequent year
- Historically provides 30-year portfolio survival
- Example: $1 million portfolio = $40,000/year initial withdrawal

### Replacement Ratio
How much pre-retirement income you need:
- General target: 70-80% of pre-retirement income
- Lower expenses in retirement (no commute, mortgage paid off)
- But healthcare costs often increase
- Calculate your specific needs

### Retirement Savings Milestones
General guidelines by age:
- **30**: 1x annual salary saved
- **40**: 3x annual salary saved
- **50**: 6x annual salary saved
- **60**: 8x annual salary saved
- **67**: 10x annual salary saved

## Retirement Income Strategies

### The Bucket Strategy
Divide portfolio into time-based buckets:

2. **Bucket 2 (3-10 years)**: Bonds, stable income investments
3. **Bucket 3 (10+ years)**: Stocks for long-term growth

### Income Floor Strategy
Guarantee essential expenses with guaranteed income:
- Social Security covers base needs
- Consider annuities for additional guaranteed income
- Invest remaining assets for growth

### Systematic Withdrawal Strategy
Withdraw fixed percentage from portfolio:
- 4% rule or dynamic variations
- Adjust based on market performance
- Requires discipline and monitoring

## Healthcare in Retirement

## Retirement Planning Mistakes

1. **Starting Too Late**: Every decade delayed costs significantly
2. **Not Maximizing Match**: Leaving free money on the table
3. **Ignoring Fees**: High fees compound negatively over decades
4. **Too Conservative Too Early**: Young savers need growth
5. **Underestimating Longevity**: Plan for 30+ year retirement
6. **Ignoring Inflation**: Purchasing power erodes over time
7. **Claiming Social Security Early**: Often leaves money on table
8. **Underestimating Healthcare Costs**: Can be largest expense
9. **Forgetting About Taxes**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals
10. **No Written Plan**: Winging it doesn't work
